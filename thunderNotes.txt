// To compile wasm version of giac for node:
Open in dev container, then from /workspaces/giac:
    ./gradlew downloadEmsdk installEmsdk activateEmsdk                     needed first time
    ./gradlew createGiacWasmJsForNode                                      to actually create .wasm and wrapper files.

Troubleshooting: if you get error 
            /usr/bin/env: 'sh\r': No such file or directory
    it means gradlew has windows line endings. Install dos2unix and then use dos2unix gradlew.
        


Output is in /workspaces/giac/build/binaries/giacggb.wasm/
From here, run 
    node nodetoy.js

nodetoy.js can test either the non-inline version (giac.node.wasm-loader.js + giacggb.wasm), or the inline version (just giac.node.wasm.js).
For use in other node-based systems just these files need to be copied.



// To debug minigiac, a terminal-based c program:
On bottom bar of vscode choose
    kit as GCC 11.2.0 x86_64...
    build variant to CMake[Debug]
    build target / debug target to [minigiac] 
    add breakpoints to, eg, minigiac.cc
    click bug icon on bottom bar to start debugging

terminal shows giac. breakpoints & debugging work.
gcc output is in build/ folder. Executable is minigiac.
